Notes:
- full screen the presentation
- hide the task bar at bottom
- find a clicker

Adjustments to the presentation:
Title slide:
- 'Intro to Machine Learning' as main title
- 'How to spot a bear' is our case of demonstrating one field of machine learning,
  which is pattern recognition/classifier

Feature engineering slide:
- move feature engineering to the next slide
- change the title to 'How to spot a bear in the wilds?'
- Ask this question to start interacting with audience: 'What is machine learning?' or
  'What do you think machine learning is?'
- Come up with the most politically and scientifically correct answer to the above question,
  such as 'constructing a computer that is capable of mimicing human reasoning, learning,
  and decision making abilities'

Presentation logic cycle:
- asking question, getting an answer, throwing the audience off, and repeat
- change the order of the slides between the weight slide and the zebra slide??

Note to ramsey:
- log out of youtube
- disable notifications during presentation
- hide taskbar

Feature engineering slide:
- put feature engineering title in the slide which the first data table shows up
- To gear audience towards answering questions the way we want them to, ask questions
  such as 'What are the specific traits/qualities you are seeing in the identification
  process?'

For tables that are too long
- only show the new information, and the grizzly bear row

Feature engineering tips:
- change the slide title to 'Summarize feature engineering'
- convert non-numerical value to numbers, because computer likes numbers and binaries
- another feature that computers like is data, large amount of data by sheer quantity,
  because computers need a large amount of data in order to be accurate and shake
  off bias
- normalize value, centered around 0
- needs a good transition phrase from feature engineering to 'Add More Data'

Visualize correlations:
- add axis names to subplots
- change name from visualizing correlations to visualizing data
- change css padding to remove extra space from top and bottom in order to display all data
  on one webpage without scrolling

Multiple dimensions:
- it is hard for humans to visualize and analyze things in multiple dimensions,
  and that is why we condense the features into principle components, pca
- thru this dataset, we will try to find a way for computer to recognize

Reminder to audience:
- we need to remind the audience at a high level that we are going thru all these mini-steps
  in order to find a way to train a computer to do pattern recognition/classification
- a svm is a technique, support vector machine, we need to look up the exact definition
  for svm, such as 'find the plane of separation between different sets of data'

Transition to neural networks:
- however, this is not how us humans think, these traditional methods require formulas
- data science vs machine learning slide -> needs to be in fragment
- point of separation, highlight of the presentation, spend 5min on the comparison slide
  between traditional method and modern method
- enter neural networks

Neural network:
- various types of neural network that have memories, attention span
- mechanism of a human neuron cell
- neural network constructe according to our datasets

Neural network visuals TODO:
- animate the training process
- animate the predict process
- neural network zoo? convolutional neural network?
- demonstrate the abilities of a trained neural network by feeding it both old data
  and new, never seen before data, for example airplane, basically a testing set

Need to divide speech parts to both Bowei and Ramsey
